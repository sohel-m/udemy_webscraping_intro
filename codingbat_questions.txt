lastDigit(6, 17) → false
lastDigit(3, 113) → true


Q30). Given a string, return a new string where the last 3 chars are now in upper case. If the string has less than 3 chars, uppercase whatever is there. Note that str.toUpperCase() returns the uppercase version of a string.

stringMatch("abc", "abc") → 2
stringMatch("abc", "axc") → 0

minCat("Hello", "java") → "ellojava"
minCat("java", "Hello") → "javaello"

extraFront("ab") → "ababab"
extraFront("H") → "HHH"


Q29). Given a string, if a length 2 substring appears at both its beginning and end, return a string without the substring at the beginning, so "HelloHe" yields "lloHe". The substring may overlap with itself, so "Hi" yields "". Otherwise, return the original string unchanged.
without2("HelloHe") → "lloHe"
without2("HelloHi") → "HelloHi"
without2("Hi") → ""


Q30). Given a string, return a version without the first 2 chars. Except keep the first char if it is 'a' and keep the second char if it is 'b'. The string may be any length. Harder than it looks.
deFront("Hello") → "llo"
deFront("java") → "va"
deFront("away") → "aay"


Q31). Given a string and a second "word" string, we'll say that the word matches the string if it appears at the front of the string, except its first char does not need to match exactly.

withoutX("xHix") → "Hi"
withoutX("xHi") → "Hi"
withoutX("Hxix") → "Hxi"


Q33). Given a string, if one or both of the first 2 chars is 'x', return the string without those 'x' chars, and otherwise return the string unchanged. This is a little harder than it looks.

alarmClock(0, false) → "10:00"


Q7). The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, a and b, return true if either one is 6. Or if their sum or difference is 6. Note: the function Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

less20(19) → true
less20(20) → false


Q13). Given a non-negative number "num", return true if num is within 2 of a multiple of 10. Note: (a % b) is the remainder of dividing a by b, so (7 % 5) is 2. See also: Introduction to Mod
nearTen(12) → true
nearTen(17) → false
nearTen(19) → true


Q14). Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, "teen" values in the range 13..19 inclusive, are extra lucky. So if either value is a teen, just return 19.

fizzString("fig") → "Fizz"
fizzString("dib") → "Buzz"
fizzString("fib") → "FizzBuzz"


Q18). Given an int n, return the string form of the number followed by "!". So the int 6 yields "6!". Except if the number is divisible by 3 use "Fizz" instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by 5 use "Buzz", and if divisible by both 3 and 5, use "FizzBuzz". Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder after division, so 23 % 10 yields 3. What will the remainder be when one number divides evenly into another? (See also: FizzBuzz Code and Introduction to Mod)
fizzString2(1) → "1!"
fizzString2(2) → "2!"
fizzString2(3) → "Fizz!"

withoutDoubles(3, 3, true) → 7
withoutDoubles(3, 3, false) → 6


Q25). Given two int values, return whichever value is larger. However if the two values have the same remainder when divided by 5, then the return the smaller value. However, in all cases, if the two values are the same, return 0. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 7 % 5 is 2.
maxMod5(2, 3) → 3
maxMod5(6, 2) → 6
maxMod5(3, 2) → 3


Q26). You have a red lottery ticket showing ints a, b, and c, each of which is 0, 1, or 2. If they are all the value 2, the result is 10. Otherwise if they are all the same, the result is 5. Otherwise so long as both b and c are different from a, the result is 1. Otherwise the result is 0.
redTicket(2, 2, 2) → 10
redTicket(2, 2, 1) → 0
redTicket(0, 0, 0) → 5


Q27). You have a green lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. If the numbers are all different from each other, the result is 0. If all of the numbers are the same, the result is 20. If two of the numbers are the same, the result is 10.
greenTicket(1, 2, 3) → 0
greenTicket(2, 2, 2) → 20
greenTicket(1, 1, 2) → 10


Q28). You have a blue lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. This makes three pairs, which we'll call ab, bc, and ac. Consider the sum of the numbers in each pair. If any pair sums to exactly 10, the result is 10. Otherwise if the ab sum is exactly 10 more than either bc or ac sums, the result is 5. Otherwise the result is 0.

blueTicket(9, 2, 0) → 0
blueTicket(6, 1, 4) → 10


Q29). Given two ints, each in the range 10..99, return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as the 2 in 12 and 23. (Note: division, e.g. n/10, gives the left digit while the % "mod" n%10 gives the right digit.)
shareDigit(12, 23) → true
shareDigit(12, 43) → false
shareDigit(12, 44) → false


Q30). Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a. If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of the string.)
sumLimit(2, 3) → 5
sumLimit(8, 3) → 8
sumLimit(8, 1) → 9





Logic-2 Medium boolean logic puzzles -- if else && || !

Write a separate helper "public int fixTeen(int n) {"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main noTeenSum().
noTeenSum(1, 2, 3) → 6
noTeenSum(2, 13, 1) → 3
noTeenSum(2, 1, 14) → 3


Q5). For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().

evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) → false

countCode("cozexxcope") → 2


Q5). Given two strings, return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring upper/lower case differences (in other words, the computation should not be "case sensitive"). Note:  str.toLowerCase() returns the lowercase version of a string.

endOther("AbC", "HiaBc") → true
endOther("abc", "abXabc") → true

prefixAgain("abXYabc", 1) → true
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 2) → true
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 3) → false


Q14). Given a string, does "xyz" appear in the middle of the string? To define middle, we'll say that the number of chars to the left and right of the "xyz" must differ by at most one. This problem is harder than it looks.
xyzMiddle("AAxyzBB") → true
xyzMiddle("AxyzBB") → true
xyzMiddle("AxyzBBB") → false


Q15). A sandwich is two pieces of bread with something in between. Return the string that is between the first and last appearance of "bread" in the given string, or return the empty string "" if there are not two pieces of bread.

sameStarChar("xy*zzz") → false
sameStarChar("*xa*az") → true


Q17). Given a string, compute a new string by moving the first char to come after the next two chars, so "abc" yields "bca". Repeat this process for each subsequent group of 3 chars, so "abcdef" yields "bcaefd". Ignore any group of fewer than 3 chars at the end.
oneTwo("abc") → "bca"
oneTwo("tca") → "cat"
oneTwo("tcagdo") → "catdog"


Q18). Look for patterns like "zip" and "zap" in the string -- length-3, starting with 'z' and ending with 'p'. Return a string where for all such words, the middle letter is gone, so "zipXzap" yields "zpXzp".

starOut("ab*cd") → "ad"
starOut("ab**cd") → "ad"
starOut("sm*eilly") → "silly"


Q20). Given a string and a non-empty word string, return a version of the original String where all chars have been replaced by pluses ("+"), except for appearances of the word string which are preserved unchanged.
plusOut("12xy34", "xy") → "++xy++"
plusOut("12xy34", "1") → "1+++++"
plusOut("12xy34xyabcxy", "xy") → "++xy++xy+++xy"


Q21). Given a string and a non-empty word string, return a string made of each char just before and just after every appearance of the word in the string. Ignore cases where there is no char before or after the word, and a char may be included twice if it is between two words.
wordEnds("abcXY123XYijk", "XY") → "c13i"
wordEnds("XY123XY", "XY") → "13"
wordEnds("XY1XY", "XY") → "11"





String-3   Harder String problems -- 2 loops

Q1). Given a string, count the number of words ending in 'y' or 'z' -- so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez" count, but not the 'y' in "yellow" (not case sensitive). We'll say that a y or z is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic letter immediately following it. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is an alphabetic letter.)
countYZ("fez day") → 2
countYZ("day fez") → 2
countYZ("day fyyyz") → 2


Q2). Given two strings, base and remove, return a version of the base string where all instances of the remove string have been removed (not case sensitive). You may assume that the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only non-overlapping instances, so with "xxx" removing "xx" leaves "x".
withoutString("Hello there", "llo") → "He there"
withoutString("Hello there", "e") → "Hllo thr"
withoutString("Hello there", "x") → "Hello there"


Q3). Given a string, return true if the number of appearances of "is" anywhere in the string is equal to the number of appearances of "not" anywhere in the string (case sensitive).
equalIsNot("This is not") → false
equalIsNot("This is notnot") → true
equalIsNot("noisxxnotyynotxisi") → true


Q4). We'll say that a lowercase 'g' in a string is "happy" if there is another 'g' immediately to its left or right. Return true if all the g's in the given string are happy.
gHappy("xxggxx") → true
gHappy("xxgxx") → false
gHappy("xxggyygxx") → false


Q5). We'll say that a "triple" in a string is a char appearing three times in a row. Return the number of triples in the given string. The triples may overlap.
countTriple("abcXXXabc") → 1
countTriple("xxxabyyyycd") → 3
countTriple("a") → 0


Q6). Given a string, return the sum of the digits 0-9 that appear in the string, ignoring all other characters. Return 0 if there are no digits in the string. (Note: Character.isDigit(char) tests if a char is one of the chars '0', '1', .. '9'. Integer.parseInt(string) converts a string to an int.)
sumDigits("aa1bc2d3") → 6
sumDigits("aa11b33") → 8
sumDigits("Chocolate") → 0


Q7). Given a string, return the longest substring that appears at both the beginning and end of the string without overlapping. For example, sameEnds("abXab") is "ab".
sameEnds("abXYab") → "ab"
sameEnds("xx") → "x"
sameEnds("xxx") → "x"


Q8). Given a string, look for a mirror image (backwards) string at both the beginning and end of the given string. In other words, zero or more characters at the very begining of the given string, and at the very end of the string in reverse order (possibly overlapping). For example, the string "abXYZba" has the mirror end "ab".
mirrorEnds("abXYZba") → "ab"
mirrorEnds("abca") → "a"
mirrorEnds("aba") → "aba"


Q9). Given a string, return the length of the largest "block" in the string. A block is a run of adjacent chars that are the same.
maxBlock("hoopla") → 2
maxBlock("abbCCCddBBBxx") → 3
maxBlock("") → 0


Q10). Given a string, return the sum of the numbers appearing in the string, ignoring all other characters. A number is a series of 1 or more digit chars in a row. (Note: Character.isDigit(char) tests if a char is one of the chars '0', '1', .. '9'. Integer.parseInt(string) converts a string to an int.)
sumNumbers("abc123xyz") → 123
sumNumbers("aa11b33") → 44
sumNumbers("7 11") → 18


Q11). Given a string, return a string where every appearance of the lowercase word "is" has been replaced with "is not". The word "is" should not be immediately preceeded or followed by a letter -- so for example the "is" in "this" does not count. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is a letter.)
notReplace("is test") → "is not test"
notReplace("is-is") → "is not-is not"
notReplace("This is right") → "This is not right"





Array-2   Medium array problems -- 1 loop

Q1). Return the number of even ints in the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.
countEvens([2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) → 3
countEvens([2, 2, 0]) → 3
countEvens([1, 3, 5]) → 0


Q2). Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. Note: the built-in Math.min(v1, v2) and Math.max(v1, v2) methods  return the smaller or larger of two values.
bigDiff([10, 3, 5, 6]) → 7
bigDiff([7, 2, 10, 9]) → 8
bigDiff([2, 10, 7, 2]) → 8


Q3). Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.
centeredAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
centeredAverage([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
centeredAverage([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3


Q4). Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that come immediately after a 13 also do not count.
sum13([1, 2, 2, 1]) → 6
sum13([1, 1]) → 2
sum13([1, 2, 2, 1, 13]) → 6


Q5). Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). Return 0 for no numbers.
sum67([1, 2, 2]) → 5
sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) → 5

more14([1, 4, 1]) → true
more14([1, 4, 1, 4]) → false
more14([1, 1]) → true


Q10). Given a number n, create and return a new int array of length n, containing the numbers 0, 1, 2, ... n-1. The given n may be 0, in which case just return a length 0 array. You do not need a separate if-statement for the length-0 case; the for-loop should naturally execute 0 times in that case, so it just works. The syntax to make a new int array is: new int[desired_length]    (See also: FizzBuzz Code)
fizzArray(4) → [0, 1, 2, 3]
fizzArray(1) → [0]
fizzArray(10) → [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


Q11). Given an array of ints, return true if every element is a 1 or a 4.
only14([1, 4, 1, 4]) → true
only14([1, 4, 2, 4]) → false
only14([1, 1]) → true


Q12). Given a number n, create and return a new string array of length n, containing the strings "0", "1" "2" .. through n-1. N may be 0, in which case just return a length 0 array. Note: String.valueOf(xxx) will make the String form of most types. The syntax to make a new string array is: new String[desired_length]  (See also: FizzBuzz Code)
fizzArray2(4) → ["0", "1", "2", "3"]
fizzArray2(10) → ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
fizzArray2(2) → ["0", "1"]

no14([1, 2, 3]) → true
no14([1, 2, 3, 4]) → false
no14([2, 3, 4]) → true


Q14). We'll say that a value is "everywhere" in an array if for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the pair is that value. Return true if the given value is everywhere in the array.
isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) → true
isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) → false
isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) → false

either24([1, 2, 2]) → true
either24([4, 4, 1]) → true
either24([4, 4, 1, 2, 2]) → false


Q16). Given arrays nums1 and nums2 of the same length, for every element in nums1, consider the corresponding element in nums2 (at the same index). Return the count of the number of times that the two elements differ by 2 or less, but are not equal.
matchUp([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 10]) → 2
matchUp([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5]) → 3
matchUp([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3]) → 2


Q17). Given an array of ints, return true if the array contains two 7's next to each other, or there are two 7's separated by one element, such as with {7, 1, 7}.
has77([1, 7, 7]) → true
has77([1, 7, 1, 7]) → true
has77([1, 7, 1, 1, 7]) → false


Q18). Given an array of ints, return true if there is a 1 in the array with a 2 somewhere later in the array.
has12([1, 3, 2]) → true
has12([3, 1, 2]) → true
has12([3, 1, 4, 5, 2]) → true


Q19). Given an array of ints, return true if the array contains either 3 even or 3 odd values all next to each other.
modThree([2, 1, 3, 5]) → true
modThree([2, 1, 2, 5]) → false
modThree([2, 4, 2, 5]) → true


Q20). Given an array of ints, return true if the value 3 appears in the array exactly 3 times, and no 3's are next to each other.
haveThree([3, 1, 3, 1, 3]) → true
haveThree([3, 1, 3, 3]) → false
haveThree([3, 4, 3, 3, 4]) → false


Q21). Given an array of ints, return true if every 2 that appears in the array is next to another 2.
twoTwo([4, 2, 2, 3]) → true
twoTwo([2, 2, 4]) → true
twoTwo([2, 2, 4, 2]) → false


Q22). Return true if the group of N numbers at the start and end of the array are the same. For example, with {5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6}, the ends are the same for n=0 and n=2, and false for n=1 and n=3. You may assume that n is in the range 0..nums.length inclusive.
sameEnds([5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6], 1) → false
sameEnds([5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6], 2) → true
sameEnds([5, 6, 45, 99, 13, 5, 6], 3) → false


Q23). Return true if the array contains, somewhere, three increasing adjacent numbers like .... 4, 5, 6, ... or 23, 24, 25.
tripleUp([1, 4, 5, 6, 2]) → true
tripleUp([1, 2, 3]) → true
tripleUp([1, 2, 4]) → false


Q24). Given start and end numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to but not including end, so start=5 and end=10 yields {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The end number will be greater or equal to the start number. Note that a length-0 array is valid. (See also: FizzBuzz Code)
fizzArray3(5, 10) → [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
fizzArray3(11, 18) → [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
fizzArray3(1, 3) → [1, 2]


Q25). Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {2, 5, 3, 6}. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array.
shiftLeft([6, 2, 5, 3]) → [2, 5, 3, 6]
shiftLeft([1, 2]) → [2, 1]
shiftLeft([1]) → [1]


Q26). For each multiple of 10 in the given array, change all the values following it to be that multiple of 10, until encountering another multiple of 10. So {2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5} yields {2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20}.
tenRun([2, 10, 3, 4, 20, 5]) → [2, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20]
tenRun([10, 1, 20, 2]) → [10, 10, 20, 20]
tenRun([10, 1, 9, 20]) → [10, 10, 10, 20]


Q27). Given a non-empty array of ints, return a new array containing the elements from the original array that come before the first 4 in the original array. The original array will contain at least one 4. Note that it is valid in java to create an array of length 0.
pre4([1, 2, 4, 1]) → [1, 2]
pre4([3, 1, 4]) → [3, 1]
pre4([1, 4, 4]) → [1]


Q28). Given a non-empty array of ints, return a new array containing the elements from the original array that come after the last 4 in the original array. The original array will contain at least one 4. Note that it is valid in java to create an array of length 0.
post4([2, 4, 1, 2]) → [1, 2]
post4([4, 1, 4, 2]) → [2]
post4([4, 4, 1, 2, 3]) → [1, 2, 3]


Q29). We'll say that an element in an array is "alone" if there are values before and after it, and those values are different from it. Return a version of the given array where every instance of the given value which is alone is replaced by whichever value to its left or right is larger.
notAlone([1, 2, 3], 2) → [1, 3, 3]
notAlone([1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2], 2) → [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 2]
notAlone([3, 4], 3) → [3, 4]


Q30). Return an array that contains the exact same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that all the zeros are grouped at the start of the array. The order of the non-zero numbers does not matter. So {1, 0, 0, 1} becomes {0 ,0, 1, 1}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.
zeroFront([1, 0, 0, 1]) → [0, 0, 1, 1]
zeroFront([0, 1, 1, 0, 1]) → [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
zeroFront([1, 0]) → [0, 1]


Q31). Return a version of the given array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces a the end of the array should be 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.
withoutTen([1, 10, 10, 2]) → [1, 2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([10, 2, 10]) → [2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([1, 99, 10]) → [1, 99, 0]


Q32). Return a version of the given array where each zero value in the array is replaced by the largest odd value to the right of the zero in the array. If there is no odd value to the right of the zero, leave the zero as a zero.
zeroMax([0, 5, 0, 3]) → [5, 5, 3, 3]
zeroMax([0, 4, 0, 3]) → [3, 4, 3, 3]
zeroMax([0, 1, 0]) → [1, 1, 0]


Q33). Return an array that contains the exact same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that all the even numbers come before all the odd numbers. Other than that, the numbers can be in any order. You may modify and return the given array, or make a new array.
evenOdd([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]) → [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
evenOdd([3, 3, 2]) → [2, 3, 3]
evenOdd([2, 2, 2]) → [2, 2, 2]


Q34). This is slightly more difficult version of the famous FizzBuzz problem which is sometimes given as a first problem for job interviews. (See also: FizzBuzz Code.) Consider the series of numbers beginning at start and running up to but not including end, so for example start=1 and end=5 gives the series 1, 2, 3, 4. Return a new String[] array containing the string form of these numbers, except for multiples of 3, use "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 use "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5 use "FizzBuzz". In Java, String.valueOf(xxx) will make the String form of an int or other type. This version is a little more complicated than the usual version since you have to allocate and index into an array instead of just printing, and we vary the start/end instead of just always doing 1..100.
fizzBuzz(1, 6) → ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz"]
fizzBuzz(1, 8) → ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7"]
fizzBuzz(1, 11) → ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz"]





Array-3   Harder array problems -- 2 loops, more complex logic

Q1). Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the "span" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1. Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)
maxSpan([1, 2, 1, 1, 3]) → 4
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4]) → 6
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]) → 6


Q2). Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 3 is immediately followed by a 4. Do not move the 3's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 3's and 4's, every 3 has a number after it that is not a 3, and a 3 appears in the array before any 4.
fix34([1, 3, 1, 4]) → [1, 3, 4, 1]
fix34([1, 3, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1]) → [1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 4]
fix34([3, 2, 2, 4]) → [3, 4, 2, 2]


Q3). (This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.) Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4. In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array.
fix45([5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]) → [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5]) → [1, 4, 5, 1]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5, 5, 4, 1]) → [1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5]


Q4). Given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.
canBalance([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → true
canBalance([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → false
canBalance([10, 10]) → true


Q5). Given two arrays of ints sorted in increasing order, outer and inner, return true if all of the numbers in inner appear in outer. The best solution makes only a single "linear" pass of both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that both arrays are already in sorted order.
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 4]) → true
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 3, 4]) → false
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 4, 6], [2, 4]) → true


Q6). Given n>=0, create an array length n*n with the following pattern, shown here for n=3 : {0, 0, 1,    0, 2, 1,    3, 2, 1} (spaces added to show the 3 groups).
squareUp(3) → [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
squareUp(2) → [0, 1, 2, 1]
squareUp(4) → [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]


Q7). Given n>=0, create an array with the pattern {1,    1, 2,    1, 2, 3,   ... 1, 2, 3 .. n} (spaces added to show the grouping). Note that the length of the array will be 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n, which is known to sum to exactly n*(n + 1)/2.
seriesUp(3) → [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
seriesUp(4) → [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]
seriesUp(2) → [1, 1, 2]


Q8). We'll say that a "mirror" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example, the largest mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part). Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the given array.
maxMirror([1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1]) → 3
maxMirror([1, 2, 1, 4]) → 3
maxMirror([7, 1, 2, 9, 7, 2, 1]) → 2


Q9). Say that a "clump" in an array is a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Return the number of clumps in the given array.
countClumps([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 2, 1, 1]) → 2
countClumps([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) → 1





AP-1   AP CS medium problems

Q1). Given an array of scores, return true if each score is equal or greater than the one before. The array will be length 2 or more.
scoresIncreasing([1, 3, 4]) → true
scoresIncreasing([1, 3, 2]) → false
scoresIncreasing([1, 1, 4]) → true


Q2). Given an array of scores, return true if there are scores of 100 next to each other in the array. The array length will be at least 2.

scores100([1, 100, 99, 100]) → false
scores100([100, 1, 100, 100]) → true


Q3). Given an array of scores sorted in increasing order, return true if the array contains 3 adjacent scores that differ from each other by at most 2, such as with {3, 4, 5} or {3, 5, 5}.
scoresClump([3, 4, 5]) → true
scoresClump([3, 4, 6]) → false
scoresClump([1, 3, 5, 5]) → true


Q4). Given an array of scores, compute the int average of the first half and the second half, and return whichever is larger. We'll say that the second half begins at index length/2. The array length will be at least 2. To practice decomposition, write a separate helper method int average(int[] scores, int start, int end) {  which computes the average of the elements between indexes start..end. Call your helper method twice to implement scoresAverage(). Write your helper method after your scoresAverage() method in the JavaBat text area. Normally you would compute averages with doubles, but here we use ints so the expected results are exact.
scoresAverage([2, 2, 4, 4]) → 4
scoresAverage([4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]) → 4
scoresAverage([3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]) → 4


Q5). Given an array of strings, return the count of the number of strings with the given length.
wordsCount(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 1) → 2
wordsCount(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 3) → 1
wordsCount(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 4) → 0


Q6). Given an array of strings, return a new array containing the first N strings. N will be in the range 1..length.
wordsFront(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 1) → ["a"]
wordsFront(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2) → ["a", "b"]
wordsFront(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 3) → ["a", "b", "c"]


Q7). Given an array of strings, return a new List (e.g. an ArrayList) where all the strings of the given length are omitted. See wordsWithout() below which is more difficult because it uses arrays.
wordsWithoutList(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 1) → ["bb", "ccc"]
wordsWithoutList(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 3) → ["a", "bb", "b"]
wordsWithoutList(["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"], 4) → ["a", "bb", "b", "ccc"]


Q8). Given a positive int n, return true if it contains a 1 digit. Note: use % to get the rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digit.
hasOne(10) → true
hasOne(22) → false
hasOne(220) → false


Q9). We'll say that a positive int divides itself if every digit in the number divides into the number evenly. So for example 128 divides itself since 1, 2, and 8 all divide into 128 evenly. We'll say that 0 does not divide into anything evenly, so no number with a 0 digit divides itself. Note: use % to get the rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digit.
dividesSelf(128) → true
dividesSelf(12) → true
dividesSelf(120) → false


Q10). Given an array of positive ints, return a new array of length "count" containing the first even numbers from the original array. The original array will contain at least "count" even numbers.
copyEvens([3, 2, 4, 5, 8], 2) → [2, 4]
copyEvens([3, 2, 4, 5, 8], 3) → [2, 4, 8]
copyEvens([6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8], 3) → [6, 2, 4]


Q11). We'll say that a positive int n is "endy" if it is in the range 0..10 or 90..100 (inclusive). Given an array of positive ints, return a new array of length "count" containing the first endy numbers from the original array. Decompose out a separate isEndy(int n) method to test if a number is endy. The original array will contain at least "count" endy numbers.
copyEndy([9, 11, 90, 22, 6], 2) → [9, 90]
copyEndy([9, 11, 90, 22, 6], 3) → [9, 90, 6]
copyEndy([12, 1, 1, 13, 0, 20], 2) → [1, 1]


Q12). Given 2 arrays that are the same length containing strings, compare the 1st string in one array to the 1st string in the other array, the 2nd to the 2nd and so on. Count the number of times that the 2 strings are non-empty and start with the same char. The strings may be any length, including 0.
matchUp(["aa", "bb", "cc"], ["aaa", "xx", "bb"]) → 1
matchUp(["aa", "bb", "cc"], ["aaa", "b", "bb"]) → 2
matchUp(["aa", "bb", "cc"], ["", "", "ccc"]) → 1


Q13). The "key" array is an array containing the correct answers to an exam, like {"a", "a", "b", "b"}. the "answers" array contains a student's answers, with "?" representing a question left blank. The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer.
scoreUp(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "c", "b", "c"]) → 6
scoreUp(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "a", "b", "c"]) → 11
scoreUp(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "a", "b", "b"]) → 16


Q14). Given an array of strings, return a new array without the strings that are equal to the target string. One approach is to count the occurrences of the target string, make a new array of the correct length, and then copy over the correct strings.
wordsWithout(["a", "b", "c", "a"], "a") → ["b", "c"]
wordsWithout(["a", "b", "c", "a"], "b") → ["a", "c", "a"]
wordsWithout(["a", "b", "c", "a"], "c") → ["a", "b", "a"]


Q15). Given two arrays, A and B, of non-negative int scores. A "special" score is one which is a multiple of 10, such as 40 or 90. Return the sum of largest special score in A and the largest special score in B. To practice decomposition, write a separate helper method which finds the largest special score in an array. Write your helper method after your scoresSpecial() method in the JavaBat text area.
scoresSpecial([12, 10, 4], [2, 20, 30]) → 40
scoresSpecial([20, 10, 4], [2, 20, 10]) → 40
scoresSpecial([12, 11, 4], [2, 20, 31]) → 20


Q16). We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the sum of the changes for a walk beginning at the start index and ending at the end index. For example, with the heights {5, 3, 6, 7, 2} and start=2, end=4 yields a sum of 1 + 5 = 6. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.
sumHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 6
sumHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 2
sumHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 11


Q17). (A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the sum of the changes for a walk beginning at the start index and ending at the end index, however increases in height count double. For example, with the heights {5, 3, 6, 7, 2} and start=2, end=4 yields a sum of 1*2 + 5 = 7. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.
sumHeights2([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 7
sumHeights2([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 2
sumHeights2([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 15


Q18). (A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the number of "big" steps for a walk starting at the start index and ending at the end index. We'll say that  step is big if it is 5 or more up or down. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 1
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 0
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 1


Q19). We have data for two users, A and B, each with a String name and an int id. The goal is to order the users such as for sorting. Return -1 if A comes before B, 1 if A comes after B, and 0 if they are the same. Order first by the string names, and then by the id numbers if the names are the same. Note: with Strings str1.compareTo(str2) returns an int value which is negative/0/positive to indicate how str1 is ordered to str2 (the value is not limited to -1/0/1). (On the AP, there would be two User objects, but here the code simply takes the two strings and two ints directly. The code logic is the same.)
userCompare("bb", 1, "zz", 2) → -1
userCompare("bb", 1, "aa", 2) → 1
userCompare("bb", 1, "bb", 1) → 0


Q20). Start with two arrays of strings, A and B, each with its elements in alphabetical order and without duplicates. Return a new array containing the first N elements from the two arrays. The result array should be in alphabetical order and without duplicates. A and B will both have a length which is N or more. The best "linear" solution makes a single pass over A and B, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order, copying elements directly to the new array.
mergeTwo(["a", "c", "z"], ["b", "f", "z"], 3) → ["a", "b", "c"]
mergeTwo(["a", "c", "z"], ["c", "f", "z"], 3) → ["a", "c", "f"]
mergeTwo(["f", "g", "z"], ["c", "f", "g"], 3) → ["c", "f", "g"]


Q21). Start with two arrays of strings, a and b, each in alphabetical order, possibly with duplicates. Return the count of the number of strings which appear in both arrays. The best "linear" solution makes a single pass over both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order.
commonTwo(["a", "c", "x"], ["b", "c", "d", "x"]) → 2
commonTwo(["a", "c", "x"], ["a", "b", "c", "x", "z"]) → 3
commonTwo(["a", "b", "c"], ["a", "b", "c"]) → 3

Q3). The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition. The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. Define a recursive fibonacci(n) method that returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.

fibonacci(2) → 1


Q4). We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears. The even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

triangle(2) → 3


Q6). Given a non-negative int n, return the sum of its digits recursively (no loops). Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while divide (/) by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).

sumDigits(49) → 13
sumDigits(12) → 3


Q7). Given a non-negative int n, return the count of the occurrences of 7 as a digit, so for example 717 yields 2. (no loops). Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while divide (/) by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).
count7(717) → 2
count7(7) → 1
count7(123) → 0


Q8). Given a non-negative int n, compute recursively (no loops) the count of the occurrences of 8 as a digit, except that an 8 with another 8 immediately to its left counts double, so 8818 yields 4. Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while divide (/) by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).
count8(8) → 1
count8(818) → 2
count8(8818) → 4


Q9). Given base and n that are both 1 or more, compute recursively (no loops) the value of base to the n power, so powerN(3, 2) is 9 (3 squared).

Q15). Given an array of ints, compute recursively if the array contains a 6. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.
array6([1, 6, 4], 0) → true
array6([1, 4], 0) → false
array6([6], 0) → true


Q16). Given an array of ints, compute recursively the number of times that the value 11 appears in the array. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.
array11([1, 2, 11], 0) → 1
array11([11, 11], 0) → 2
array11([1, 2, 3, 4], 0) → 0


Q17). Given an array of ints, compute recursively if the array contains somewhere a value followed in the array by that value times 10. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.

endX("xhixhix") → "hihixxx"


Q21). We'll say that a "pair" in a string is two instances of a char separated by a char. So "AxA" the A's make a pair. Pair's can overlap, so "AxAxA" contains 3 pairs -- 2 for A and 1 for x. Recursively compute the number of pairs in the given string.
countPairs("axa") → 1
countPairs("axax") → 2
countPairs("axbx") → 1


Q22). Count recursively the total number of "abc" and "aba" substrings that appear in the given string.
countAbc("abc") → 1
countAbc("abcxxabc") → 2
countAbc("abaxxaba") → 2


Q23). Given a string, compute recursively (no loops) the number of "11" substrings in the string. The "11" substrings should not overlap.

count11("abc11x11x11") → 3
count11("111") → 1


Q24). Given a string, return recursively a "cleaned" string where adjacent chars that are the same have been reduced to a single char. So "yyzzza" yields "yza".
stringClean("yyzzza") → "yza"
stringClean("abbbcdd") → "abcd"
stringClean("Hello") → "Helo"


Q25). Given a string, compute recursively the number of times lowercase "hi" appears in the string, however do not count "hi" that have an 'x' immedately before them.

countHi2("ahibhi") → 2
countHi2("xhixhi") → 0

parenBit("x(hello)") → "(hello)"
parenBit("(xy)1") → "(xy)"


Q27). Given a string, return true if it is a nesting of zero or more pairs of parenthesis, like "(())" or "((()))". Suggestion: check the first and last chars, and then recur on what's inside them.
nestParen("(())") → true
nestParen("((()))") → true

strDist("cccatcowcatxx", "cat") → 9





Recursion-2 Harder recursion problems

Q1). Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints, such that the group sums to the given target? This is a classic backtracking recursion problem. Once you understand the recursive backtracking strategy in this problem, you can use the same pattern for many problems to search a space of choices. Rather than looking at the whole array, our convention is to consider the part of the array starting at index start and continuing to the end of the array. The caller can specify the whole array simply by passing start as 0. No loops are needed -- the recursive calls progress down the array.
groupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 10) → true
groupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 14) → true
groupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 9) → false


Q2). Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints, beginning at the start index, such that the group sums to the given target? However, with the additional constraint that all 6's must be chosen. (No loops needed.)
groupSum6(0, [5, 6, 2], 8) → true
groupSum6(0, [5, 6, 2], 9) → false
groupSum6(0, [5, 6, 2], 7) → false


Q3). Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints, such that the group sums to the given target with this additional constraint: If a value in the array is chosen to be in the group, the value immediately following it in the array must not be chosen. (No loops needed.)
groupNoAdj(0, [2, 5, 10, 4], 12) → true
groupNoAdj(0, [2, 5, 10, 4], 14) → false
groupNoAdj(0, [2, 5, 10, 4], 7) → false


Q4). Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints, such that the group sums to the given target with these additional constraints: all multiples of 5 in the array must be included in the group. If the value immediately following a multiple of 5 is 1, it must not be chosen. (No loops needed.)
groupSum5(0, [2, 5, 10, 4], 19) → true
groupSum5(0, [2, 5, 10, 4], 17) → true
groupSum5(0, [2, 5, 10, 4], 12) → false


Q5). Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints, such that the group sums to the given target, with this additional constraint: if there are numbers in the array that are adjacent and the identical value, they must either all be chosen, or none of them chosen. For example, with the array {1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2}, either all three 2's in the middle must be chosen or not, all as a group. (one loop can be used to find the extent of the identical values).
groupSumClump(0, [2, 4, 8], 10) → true
groupSumClump(0, [1, 2, 4, 8, 1], 14) → true
groupSumClump(0, [2, 4, 4, 8], 14) → false


Q6). Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sums of the two groups are the same. Every int must be in one group or the other. Write a recursive helper method that takes whatever arguments you like, and make the initial call to your recursive helper from splitArray(). (No loops needed.)
splitArray([2, 2]) → true
splitArray([2, 3]) → false
splitArray([5, 2, 3]) → true


Q7). Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of one group is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the other group is odd. Every int must be in one group or the other. Write a recursive helper method that takes whatever arguments you like, and make the initial call to your recursive helper from splitOdd10(). (No loops needed.)
splitOdd10([5, 5, 5]) → true
splitOdd10([5, 5, 6]) → false
splitOdd10([5, 5, 6, 1]) → true


Q8). Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of the two groups is the same, with these constraints: all the values that are multiple of 5 must be in one group, and all the values that are a multiple of 3 (and not a multiple of 5) must be in the other. (No loops needed.)
split53([1, 1]) → true
split53([1, 1, 1]) → false
split53([2, 4, 2]) → true

topping2({"yogurt": "salt"}) → {"yogurt": "salt"}


Q6). Given a map of food keys and topping values, modify and return the map as follows:  if the key "potato" has a value, set that as the value for the key "fries". If the key "salad" has a value, set that as the value for the key "spinach".
topping3({"potato": "ketchup"}) → {"potato": "ketchup", "fries": "ketchup"}
topping3({"potato": "butter"}) → {"potato": "butter", "fries": "butter"}
topping3({"salad": "oil", "potato": "ketchup"}) → {"spinach": "oil", "salad": "oil", "potato": "ketchup", "fries": "ketchup"}


Q7). Modify and return the given map as follows: if the keys "a" and "b" are both in the map and have equal values, remove them both.

Q1). Given an array of strings, return a Map<String, Integer> containing a key for every different string in the array, always with the value 0. For example the string "hello" makes the pair "hello":0. We'll do more complicated counting later, but for this problem the value is simply 0.
word0(["a", "b", "a", "b"]) → {"a": 0, "b": 0}
word0(["a", "b", "a", "c", "b"]) → {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}
word0(["c", "b", "a"]) → {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}


Q2). Given an array of strings, return a Map<String, Integer> containing a key for every different string in the array, and the value is that string's length.
wordLen(["a", "bb", "a", "bb"]) → {"bb": 2, "a": 1}
wordLen(["this", "and", "that", "and"]) → {"that": 4, "and": 3, "this": 4}
wordLen(["code", "code", "code", "bug"]) → {"code": 4, "bug": 3}


Q3). Given an array of non-empty strings, create and return a Map<String, String> as follows: for each string add its first character as a key with its last character as the value.
pairs(["code", "bug"]) → {"b": "g", "c": "e"}
pairs(["man", "moon", "main"]) → {"m": "n"}
pairs(["man", "moon", "good", "night"]) → {"g": "d", "m": "n", "n": "t"}


Q4). The classic word-count algorithm: given an array of strings, return a Map<String, Integer> with a key for each different string, with the value the number of times that string appears in the array.
wordCount(["a", "b", "a", "c", "b"]) → {"a": 2, "b": 2, "c": 1}
wordCount(["c", "b", "a"]) → {"a": 1, "b": 1, "c": 1}
wordCount(["c", "c", "c", "c"]) → {"c": 4}


Q5). Given an array of non-empty strings, return a Map<String, String> with a key for every different first character seen, with the value of all the strings starting with that character appended together in the order they appear in the array.
firstChar(["salt", "tea", "soda", "toast"]) → {"s": "saltsoda", "t": "teatoast"}
firstChar(["aa", "bb", "cc", "aAA", "cCC", "d"]) → {"a": "aaaAA", "b": "bb", "c": "cccCC", "d": "d"}
firstChar([]) → {}


Q6). Loop over the given array of strings to build a result string like this: when a string appears the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. time in the array, append the string to the result. Return the empty string if no string appears a 2nd time.
wordAppend(["a", "b", "a"]) → "a"
wordAppend(["a", "b", "a", "c", "a", "d", "a"]) → "aa"
wordAppend(["a", "", "a"]) → "a"


Q7). Given an array of strings, return a Map<String, Boolean> where each different string is a key and its value is true if that string appears 2 or more times in the array.
wordMultiple(["a", "b", "a", "c", "b"]) → {"a": true, "b": true, "c": false}
wordMultiple(["c", "b", "a"]) → {"a": false, "b": false, "c": false}
wordMultiple(["c", "c", "c", "c"]) → {"c": true}


Q8). We'll say that 2 strings "match" if they are non-empty and their first chars are the same. Loop over and then return the given array of non-empty strings as follows: if a string matches an earlier string in the array, swap the 2 strings in the array. When a position in the array has been swapped, it no longer matches anything. Using a map, this can be solved making just one pass over the array. More difficult than it looks.
allSwap(["ab", "ac"]) → ["ac", "ab"]
allSwap(["ax", "bx", "cx", "cy", "by", "ay", "aaa", "azz"]) → ["ay", "by", "cy", "cx", "bx", "ax", "azz", "aaa"]
allSwap(["ax", "bx", "ay", "by", "ai", "aj", "bx", "by"]) → ["ay", "by", "ax", "bx", "aj", "ai", "by", "bx"]


Q9). We'll say that 2 strings "match" if they are non-empty and their first chars are the same. Loop over and then return the given array of non-empty strings as follows: if a string matches an earlier string in the array, swap the 2 strings in the array. A particular first char can only cause 1 swap, so once a char has caused a swap, its later swaps are disabled. Using a map, this can be solved making just one pass over the array. More difficult than it looks.
firstSwap(["ab", "ac"]) → ["ac", "ab"]
firstSwap(["ax", "bx", "cx", "cy", "by", "ay", "aaa", "azz"]) → ["ay", "by", "cy", "cx", "bx", "ax", "aaa", "azz"]
firstSwap(["ax", "bx", "ay", "by", "ai", "aj", "bx", "by"]) → ["ay", "by", "ax", "bx", "ai", "aj", "bx", "by"]
